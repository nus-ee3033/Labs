# Prerequisites for this course

This page should contain information on what is required from students before entering the course. These can be prerequisite knowledge, skills, or hardware. 

If there are other things students need to do to prepare (e.g. install software), additional pages can be added in this directory (`docs/prep`) and in the sidebar using `mkdocs.yml`.
