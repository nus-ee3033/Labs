# How to use this website

## Conventions

!!! note
	Notes are used to provide extra information that may not be necessary, but hopefully interesting. These are not required knowledge. 

!!! tip
	Tips are used to provide useful information that may make your life easier when using the tools and devices. We recommend reading and remembering these. 

!!! info 
	Info panels provide some information about the content in the page. For example, lab manuals with an associated graded assignment use an Info panel at the top to remind you that they are, in fact, graded. 

!!! warning
	Warnings are used for important information that, if disregarded, may likely cause you problems. These may be common mistakes or pitfalls, or reminders to be careful. In this course, these will not have implications for your physical safety... probably. 

!!! question 
	Questions are used to indicate questions you must answer in your lab report.
